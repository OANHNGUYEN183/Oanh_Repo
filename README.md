## Step 1: Create and Open a Codespace

1. Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.
2. Open the repository and click on the "Code" button.
3. Select "Codespaces" and click "Create codespace on main".

## Step 2: Set Up Python Environment

1. Open the terminal in your Codespace.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (it should be pre-installed):
   ```
   python --version
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Step 3: Install Playwright

1. Install Playwright using pip:
   ```
   pip install playwright
   ```
2. Install the required browsers:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

## Step 4: Create a Sample Test

1. Create a new file named `test_example.py`:
   ```
   touch test_example.py
   ```
2. Open the file and add a simple test:
   ```python
   from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

   def test_example():
       with sync_playwright() as p:
           browser = p.chromium.launch()
           page = browser.new_page()
           page.goto("http://playwright.dev")
           print(page.title())
           browser.close()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       test_example()
   ```

## Step 5: Run the Test

Execute the test using Python:
```
python test_example.py
```

## Step 6: Add Requirements File

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   touch requirements.txt
   ```
2. Add Playwright to the requirements:
   ```
   echo "playwright" >> requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 7: Configure GitHub Actions (Optional)

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory:
   ```
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```
2. Create a YAML file for the workflow:
   ```
   touch .github/workflows/playwright.yml
   ```
3. Add the following content to `playwright.yml`:
   ```yaml
   name: Playwright Tests
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Set up Python
         uses: actions/setup-python@v2
         with:
           python-version: '3.x'
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           python -m pip install --upgrade pip
           pip install -r requirements.txt
       - name: Install Playwright browsers
         run: playwright install
       - name: Run Playwright tests
         run: python test_example.py
   ```

## Step 8: Commit and Push

Commit your changes and push to GitHub:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Playwright with Python setup"
git push
```

This setup allows you to use Playwright with Python in GitHub Codespaces, run tests, and even set up automated testing with GitHub Actions.
